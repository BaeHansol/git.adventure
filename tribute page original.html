              <p>Strict laws apply to drug offenders in Korea. Although he tested negative in a drug test, he could not overcome the pressure of being reported in real time by the media as to whether or not he would attend the ongoing police investigation, and as a result, he committed suicide. Personally, I think the Korean media is of a very low standard and does not protect the privacy of celebrities. There are many cases where many celebrities ended their lives due to such invasion of privacy and evaluation. Your favorite actor's private life should not be related to his public life. Mourning the death of a favorite actor.
